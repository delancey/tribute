            <p class="text-justify">Many people dont realize it, but DJ Dummy has been working and touring as a professional DJ since 1996. That"s 20+ years! His first foray on the road took him out of college mid-semester to tour with the rap group Group Home, and he"s been on the go ever since.</p>

      <h2 class="text-danger">Biography</h2>
      <p>Crazy like a Fox has never been as true as in the case of hip-hop mixmaster DJ Dummy.  Every step in this dynamo career has been crafted like that of a mad genius.  The product of a DJ-driven family, Dummy has been leaving audiences dumbstruck with his style and finess since the age of 7.  By 14, this mastermind was spinning alongside the greats in the Supermen DJ Battle of 1991.  Dummy went on to place second in the Zulu Nation Battle of 96, third in the American DMC Battle of 98, and winner of the New York Regional DMC Battle in which also took place in 1998.</p>

      <p>As a battle DJ, Dummy has been a sought-after staple in the industry due to his uncanny ability to entice and engage crowds of all sizes and demographics.  As a live concert DJ, and original member of the infamous mixtape company Tape Kingz, Dummy paved his own way into becoming the premiere choice DJ for hip-hop concerts dating back to the mid-90"s.  Studying his crowd and catering shows to fit their energy, Dummy continues to captivate audiences as he performs at the concerts and tours of Common, Talib Kweli, De La Soul, Kanye West, Music Soulchild, and Mos Def, to name a few.</p>

      <p>A 20+ year veteran of the DJ circuit, Dummy has toured internationally and entertained individual and corporate clients such as President Barack Obama, Prince, LeBron James, Venus Williams, the NBA, NFL, Red Bull, Nike, Hennesey, and many more.  The thought process of this amazing hip-hop impresario goes well beyond the tables, and thus armed with a compassionate personal connection, Dummy founded the 12 Inch Assassins in 1996.  Organized to provide the hip-hop community with professional, innovative and talented DJs, 12 Inch Assassins ventured beyond basic party DJ service to include touring, studio production, lighting and concerts. </p>

      <p>Dummy can be heard guest-appearing on radio shows worldwide, including local and satellite radio stations such as Backspin on SiriusXM.  DJ Dummy is known for his ability to not only create recorded mixes, but to also recreate those skills live on stage. As he continues to stupify audiences and fans across the globe, Dummy consistently raises his own bar of acheivements and talents.  Should the rest of the world choose to ignore the powerhouse that he has already proven to be, it would definitely leave us wondering, who's the real dummy?</p>
